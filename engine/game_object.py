# we need to take the decision whether we use

# like for parenting gameObjects
# and making the scene tree

# let's use gameObjects
# in the same way unity does.
# unity doesn't allow you to create instances of transform
# by yourself.
# Transforms are created when creating gameObjects

# in unity, to go through a hierarchy, we do it using
# the transform and not the gameObject

    # we should take classes and instantiate components ourselves?

    # and then use the parameter name as a constructor.
