# are we going to deal with VAOs at this level?
# i.e, are we going to set uniform values? -> uniform values have nothing to do with VAOs!
# if that's so, what's the difference with the mesh renderer?
# the mesh renderer should be the object that groups mesh and material together
# a material can not be used to draw a mesh (the actual call to glDraw)
# that's the job of the mesh renderer.

# materials should offer an API to update them
# and most likely, it's the mesh renderer in its 'update' method
# the one updating the material but we could also do it directly by
# grabbing the reference

# to set uniform values:
# - we need the loc -> do it only once at setup time (we DONT need to load the program for that).
# - we need to set the uniform -> we need the program to be bound
#   -> therefore, we want an interface that set a value and internally activates the shader
#   -> but we also want a faster version that sets a value (like some time or matrix)
#       without 'using' the program every time (done only once)
# - does opengl performs an expensive operation glUseProgram if the program id passed is the same?
# for now, let's use the rule that we 'use' the program for every uniform change
